    <h2 class="artic-word-heading">What is a Role Code?</h2>
    <p>
        In the ITSM (IT Service Management) system, each role has an associated <strong>Role Code</strong>.
        This code is developed by the IT department and is used to identify and manage the permissions for different roles.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Why is a Role Code needed?</h3>
    <p>
        Each role in the system has different permissions, and the Role Code is the unique identifier
        used to assign and manage these permissions. If you need to change your role, please contact
        the IT department or relevant administrator to obtain the correct Role Code for the role change.
    </p>

    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Each role has different permissions; please apply for role changes carefully.</li>
        <li>Only users with the correct Role Code can successfully switch to the target role in the system.</li>
        <li>If you have any questions, please contact the IT department or system administrator.</li>
