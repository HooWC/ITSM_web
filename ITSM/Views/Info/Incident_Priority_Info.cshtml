    <h2 class="artic-word-heading">A Key Mechanism for IT Service Requests</h2>
    <p>
        In the ITSM (IT Service Management) incident system, <strong>priority</strong> is a critical factor that determines the order in which service requests or incidents are addressed. A well-designed priority mechanism helps IT teams allocate resources and dispatch tickets efficiently based on business impact and urgency, thereby ensuring business continuity and improving response effectiveness.

    <h3>1. Composition of Priority: Impact × Urgency</h3>
    <p>
        In practice, priority is not determined subjectively, but rather through the combination of two key dimensions:
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Impact</strong>: The scope of the effect an incident or request has on the business or users. It is classified as:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 - High</strong>: Affects the entire organization or critical business functions.</li>
            <li><strong>2 - Medium</strong>: Affects specific departments or non-critical business functions.</li>
            <li><strong>3 - Low</strong>: Affects individual users or low-sensitivity scenarios.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Urgency</strong>: How quickly the issue needs to be resolved. It is classified as:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 - High</strong>: Must be resolved immediately to avoid major consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>2 - Medium</strong>: Should be addressed soon, but some delay is acceptable.</li>
            <li><strong>3 - Low</strong>: Flexible resolution time that does not impact business continuity.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        By combining these two dimensions, incidents and requests can be assessed more scientifically to determine their priority.

    <h3>3. The Purpose of Priority</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Improved Response Efficiency</strong><br />
        High-priority issues are addressed first, preventing prolonged disruptions to critical business services.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Rational Resource Allocation</strong><br />
        Support personnel and technical resources are assigned dynamically according to priority, minimizing waste.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Enhanced User Trust</strong><br />
        A transparent, visible priority mechanism increases confidence and satisfaction with IT services.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Practical Recommendations</h3>
    <p><strong>Auto-Assign Priority</strong>: Use rules in the ticketing system to automatically determine priority based on impact and urgency.</p>
    <p><strong>Support Manual Adjustment</strong>: Allow human intervention for special cases to ensure flexibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Color-Based Identification</strong>: Use color indicators in ticket lists and dashboards to enhance visibility and facilitate faster response.</p>
