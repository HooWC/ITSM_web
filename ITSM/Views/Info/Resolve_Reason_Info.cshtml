    <h2 class="artic-word-heading">What is Resolve Reason?</h2>
    <p>
        In an ITSM (IT Service Management) system, the <strong>Resolve Reason</strong> field is used by technical support staff or administrators to provide a brief explanation when an issue is resolved or closed. This explanation describes how the issue was resolved, making it easier to address similar issues in the future.
    </p>
    <p><strong>⚠️ Only Admin and ITIL users can fill in the Resolve Reason.</strong></p>
    <hr />
    <h2>When to enter a Resolve Reason?</h2>
    <p>
        A Resolve Reason should only be entered when the issue has been fully addressed, the error has been corrected, or appropriate actions have been taken. This ensures that the recorded information is accurate and complete, helping to build a knowledge base and enabling quicker issue resolution in the future.
