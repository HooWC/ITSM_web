    <h2 class="artic-word-heading">Assignment</h2>
    <p>In an ITSM system, the Assignment module is used to assign tickets (or tasks) to specific support groups and personnel to resolve issues more efficiently. Assignment mainly includes the following two parts:</p>
    <hr />
    <ul>
        <li>Assignment group</li>
        <li>Assigned to</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. Assignment Group</h3>
    <p>First, users need to select the Assignment group, i.e., the department or support team to which the issue will be assigned (e.g., IT, HR, Sales, etc.).</p>
    <p>After selecting the Assignment group, the system automatically loads the list of assignable personnel belonging to that group.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>2. Assigned To</h3>
    <p>Assigned to refers to the specific support personnel. After selecting an Assignment group, users can select the desired assignee from the Assigned to field.</p>
    <p>Only users with Admin and ITIL roles can see the Assigned to option and perform assignment operations in the system.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>3. Permissions</h3>
    <p>Only Admin and ITIL users have permission to assist users in processing issues. Regular users just need to submit the request.</p>
    <p>When regular users submit a ticket, they cannot specify the Assigned to field; they can only select the Assignment group. The system then automatically assigns the ticket, or an authorized user assigns it manually.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>4. Use Case</h3>
    <p>The user submits a ticket and selects an Assignment group (for example, "Software Group").</p>
    <p>The system automatically loads the members of the software group into the Assigned to field.</p>
    <p>An Admin or ITIL user then selects the specific support personnel from Assigned to and completes the assignment.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>5. Summary</h3>
    <p>The Assignment feature enables more refined ticket management and flow by reasonably setting the assignment group and assignee, ensuring issues are handled in a timely and efficient manner.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>If you have any questions, please contact the IT department or the relevant person in charge.</p>
