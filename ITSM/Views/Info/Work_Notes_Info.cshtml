    <h2 class="artic-word-heading">Work Notes</h2>
    <p>In the ITSM (IT Service Management) system, the <strong>Work Notes</strong> feature is a crucial tool for real-time communication and problem documentation among team members within the Incident module.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>What are Work Notes?</h3>
    <p>Work Notes function as an instant messaging tool, allowing support personnel, administrators, and other stakeholders to discuss and record information about a specific Incident Item. It is similar to a group chat on WhatsApp or WeChat, dedicated to issue analysis, progress updates, and solution discussions around that incident.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Main Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Communication</strong><br>Support personnel can quickly raise questions or share updates, and other team members can respond instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Record</strong><br>All conversation content is saved as part of the incident’s history, making it easy to review the problem-solving process later.</li>
        <li><strong>Focused on the Issue</strong><br>All conversations are tied specifically to this Incident Item, avoiding mixed information and helping teams stay focused on resolving the issue.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Discussing problem analysis steps</li>
        <li>Recording intermediate steps and test results</li>
        <li>Sharing external information (e.g., screenshots, logs)</li>
        <li>Requesting colleague assistance</li>
        <li>Confirming issue resolution or reassigning tasks</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>Recommendation</h3>
    <p>We encourage support personnel to actively use Work Notes for communication and documentation during daily operations. This not only speeds up problem resolution but also provides valuable insights for future reviews. If you have any questions, please contact the IT department or system administrator.</p>
