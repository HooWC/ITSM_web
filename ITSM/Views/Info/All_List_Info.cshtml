    <h2>ITSM Table List Operating Instructions</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. Page Layout and Data Display</h3>
    <p>
        Each page displays 18 data items (Items) to ensure clarity and ease of browsing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data list is sorted by time, displaying the most recent data first and the oldest last, allowing users to view the latest entries conveniently.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <h3>2. Search Function</h3>
    <p>
        A search box is provided at the top of the page, allowing users to quickly filter the list content using keywords.
    </p>
    <p>
        The search supports fuzzy queries, enabling matches within titles, content, or other fields to improve search efficiency.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>3. Sorting Function</h3>
    <p>
        Some Table Lists support click-to-sort, allowing users to sort data in ascending or descending order by newest or oldest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sorting helps users view data more flexibly, for example, to see historical or the latest data.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>4. Data Operations</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Edit Data</strong><br />
        The title of the first item in the list is displayed in blue. Users can click this link to enter the edit interface for that data.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the edit interface, users can modify data details and save updates.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>5. Delete Data</h3>
    <p>
        A checkbox is provided next to each data item, allowing users to select the items they want to delete.
    </p>
    <p>
        After checking the desired items, click the "Delete" button on the page to execute the deletion operation and remove the selected data. Bulk deletion is also supported to save users time.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>6. Status Management</h3>
    <p>
        Some Table Lists display the current status of each data item (e.g., In Progress, Completed, Pending Review, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
        The status field can be sorted or filtered using the search function, helping users manage task workflows efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
        The above is a basic introduction to the ITSM Table List page functionality. Through proper pagination, search, sorting, and edit/delete operations, the system's data management capabilities and user experience are significantly improved.
