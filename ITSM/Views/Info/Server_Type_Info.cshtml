    <h2 class="artic-word-heading">What is Product Type?</h2>
    <p>
        In our system, the Product Type is used to categorize the products and services we provide, making management and tracking easier. It is mainly divided into two types:
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. Product</h3>
    <p>
        Products refer to tangible or intangible items that we deliver independently to customers. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical goods (such as hardware, equipment, mouse, computer)</li>
        <li>One-time deliverables</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Products usually include specific versions, configurations, specifications, or delivery requirements.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>2. Service</h3>
    <p>
        Services refer to the support, collaboration, consulting, or long-term operational maintenance we provide to customers. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Technical support</li>
        <li>Consulting services</li>
        <li>System maintenance services</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>Why distinguish between Product and Service?</h3>
    <p>
        Clearly distinguishing between Products and Services helps to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ Standardize the delivery process</li>
        <li>✅ Ensure customers receive the correct content they need</li>
    </ul>
